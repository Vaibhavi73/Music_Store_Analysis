Music Store Database Analysis using SQL
This project involves analyzing a music store database using SQL. The dataset contains information about artists and their contributions to the music store, including:

1. Artist profiles: Detailed information about each artist, including personal details such as names, birthdates, and countries of origin.
2. Song contributions: Analysis of the number of songs each artist has contributed, helping to identify the most prolific artists in the collection.
3. Genre association: Categorizing artists by the genres they primarily work in, giving insights into genre representation in the music store.
4. Artist distribution: Exploration of the geographical spread of artists to understand regional diversity and the global representation of musical talent.


The SQL queries used in this project were designed to extract and organize artist data, providing valuable insights into the music storeâ€™s artist database. 
This analysis can help in curating artist-centric content and improving the overall artist management strategy.
